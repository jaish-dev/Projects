# Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture

This project uses machine learning to detect plant diseases to improve agricultural practices and promote sustainable farming. By analyzing images of plant leaves, the system can classify diseases and provide insights into necessary treatments. The system aims to help farmers reduce crop losses and minimize pesticide usage.
