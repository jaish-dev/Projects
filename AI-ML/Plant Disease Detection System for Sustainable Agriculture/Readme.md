# **🌿 Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture**  

## **🔍 Overview**  
The **Plant Disease Detection System** is a machine learning-based solution designed to help farmers and agricultural experts **identify plant diseases** from leaf images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, this system enables early detection, reducing crop damage and improving yield sustainability.  

## **🚀 Features**  
✅ **Image-Based Disease Detection** – Classifies plant diseases using a deep learning model.  
✅ **Fast & Accurate** – Provides quick and precise disease identification.  
✅ **User-Friendly** – Can be integrated into mobile/web applications for ease of use.  
✅ **Sustainable Agriculture** – Helps in early disease prevention, reducing pesticide misuse.
